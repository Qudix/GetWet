## Get Wet

This is a work-in-progress mod that allows you to set skin parameters on your character, or to various NPC's you come across. Integration with other mods will come later.

Can be customized through the in-game MCM.

All changes will be reflected to an external .json file located in:
"Data\Configs\qdx-get-wet\Settings\Custom.json"

Do *not* modify Default.json
